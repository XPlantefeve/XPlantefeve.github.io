    Relocating abroad for personal reasons, I found an opportunity to learn new skills and was hired as an Oracle database administrator by one of the biggest French bank services company. There, I worked mainly on Oracle, but also on MySQL and SQL server, and worked also on infrastructure within the Service Desk, mainly on Red Hat Linux. I used my automation skills to streamline database creations and administration, and worked on scripts to ease Windows/Linux interaction.
