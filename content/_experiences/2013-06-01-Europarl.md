    At the European Parliament, I worked for the DG Itec, that provides IT services mainly for the Members and their assistants and other VIPs. I was hired as the main automation expert, rewriting old VBScript, command files or more exotic solutions to PowerShell. I was the main provider of data the service manager was needing for his reports, consolidating informations from SQL server DBs, Active directory, SCCM, log files, workstations registry and event logs, etc. A main project has been to conceive, develop and put into production a system to handle local workstations and user data for the members during a hardware replacement campaign. It was done entirely in Powershell, using Group policies, security groups, scheduled tasks, queues, GUI portions when needed for operators, and CMDLets written to administrate the system on the console.
