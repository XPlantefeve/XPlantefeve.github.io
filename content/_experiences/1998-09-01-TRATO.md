  Main tasks were Exchange administration, workstations installation an upgrades, network administration, users administration, user support.
  
  The environment was mainly Windows NT 3.51, NT4 on PCs and Alpha stations, NT Server 4.0. Macintoshes were being phased out. A mainframe was used for production purposes, but I only had very punctual interventions on it.
  
  I switched the local culture from walk-on to remote administration, using Sysinternals tools, VNC, and other such tools.

Main tasks were Exchange administration, workstations installation an upgrades, network administration, users administration, user support.
