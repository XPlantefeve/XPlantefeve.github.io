    When I came back to Brussels, I was asked to return to the European Parliament to work on handling automation for the updated infrastructure. I am now working on auditing the existing scripts and bringing them up to date, as well as upgrading the data migration system I put in place a couple of years ago. I'm also tutoring members on my team on PowerShell.
