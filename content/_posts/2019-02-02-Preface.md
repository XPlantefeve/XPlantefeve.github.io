I could have called this page *Hello World*, but it would have been so clich√©...

Welcome, don't mind the mess, things are starting up and I didn't touch HTML
for the best part of the last ten years. Also, excuse my French, and I mean
that literally: I'm a very dilettante English speaker.

There are many things here that I need to build or to tidy up, hopefully it will
come little by little. I've had in my mind for quite some time the idea of
setting-up a small presentation page about myself. I sometimes felt the urge to
write about a small, mostly uninteresting thing I've been working on, but found
no info about on the Net. I've been intrigued by the idea of a static web site,
and Github seemed to want me to try it. And finally, I started a job a couple of
months ago, and I found myself more than on winding down at the end of the day,
closing my tabs one by one, and discovering my learning day have been productive,
and I wanted to keep a trace of that.

Finally, I took all those ideas, an made a bundle, that you're now reading.

Welcome, have no expectations.
