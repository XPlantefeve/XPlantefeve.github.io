A short note: obviously, this website being about discovering new things, I set it aside
once I had discovered it.

I had just set up Jekyll on my computer, then the powers that be blocked all proxy requests
for non registered apps, it cut out my git workflow, and voila.

Now, thanks to the recent creation on my very own Rube-Goldberg machine, I can now update
this web site on my NAS, by using Jekyll in a docker container, accessing it through a web
ssh client, itself running in another container, and served by a nginx reverse proxy running
on a web-faced server, communicating with the NAS through a VPN (that uses port forwarding
to pass through my router, obviously).

It means I am now able to update this place, it does not mean that I'm willing to. The whole
idea of documenting what I'm doing crumbled very quickly: documentation is a must for
project that will last, it's cumbersome for losts of small discoveries in rapid fire. That's
why I won't commit myself to regular updates, let's just see how things evolve.
