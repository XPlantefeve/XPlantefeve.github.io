A somewhat productive sunday between the house chores:

- There are matches in SSH_Config (gist auth problem)
- Cygwin Git => msysGit => msys2Git => Git for Windows has a convoluted
  history.
- CMDer uses G4Win
- Discovered [Git bundles](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bundle) one year too
  late.
- I never noticed the switch to the official Win10 OpenSSH client.
- And Win10 OpenSSH is responsible for tmux constant redraws: use CMDer one.
- You can include PSTypeName in a PSCustomObject, rather than inserting type
  later.
- Everything that can be done in a Ps1Xml can be done with Update-Type.
- `New-ScheduledTaskTrigger` cannot create an "on event" trigger, but you
  can directly feed a CIM instance to `Register-ScheduledTask`.
- The Windows.Networking.Connectivity.NetworkInformation assembly has a weird
  way of being loaded.
- There's a way to prevent Dropbox & CrashPlan from killing my metered plan.
- Wrote a first post for the website.
