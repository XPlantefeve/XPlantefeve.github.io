- `Add-Type -AssemblyName` doesn't work in a class declaration: being that the
  file is loaded in one go and checked for errors before being executed, the
  assembly is not loaded. Solutions:
  1. A script that loads assembly, then sources the class declarations.
  2. In a module, initialise *RequiredAssemblies*.
- `[System.Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::new($UserName)` creates
  a logon event (type 3) for the user.
- Nullable types are unsurprinzingly not seen as vanilla types in constructor
  overloads.
