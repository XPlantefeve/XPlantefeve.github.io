I breed organic and free-range scripts and automation. I have a love story with PowerShell, and a long history of peaking under Active Directory's hood. I've got years of experience with Microsoft technologies, and I once spent a couple of years as an Oracle DB admin on Linux, just because learning new things is fun.

I don't like using the mouse, I'm easily bored by repetitive tasks so I learned how to make a computer perform them for me. I'm currently having a very interested look at toolmaking, tests-driven script writing, Python, Azure, containers and all things Devops. I easily forget skills I don't use anymore to make room for new ones.

What I know is not important. How quickly I learn is.
