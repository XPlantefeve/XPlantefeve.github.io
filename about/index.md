## Who, me?

I wasn't into IT as a kid, I stumbled into the field. I was bad at school.
Then I started to work, and something clicked.

I spent years putting a lot of energy into being lazy. It took a while before
learning that it was called *automation*. During what starts to be called a
career, I went from small local companies to huge inter-governmental
institutions, side-stepping in banking services companies or multinational
manufacturers. And I never stopped having fun, because IT is a field
where you never stop learning, and learning is my favourite game.

The day I bought my first computer, I broke it by editing an ini file that
was best left untouched. I went from that ini file to registry, which is still
a fun playground years later. Then I upped a level and discovered Active
Directory, and I felt in love.

Since then, I automated many versions of Windows, had fun with batch files
hundreds of lines long, voiced my anger at vbscript, took a detour to
be an Oracle DBA on Linux and AIX for a couple of years, discovered the fun
of being told I had 20 minutes to solve a problem before a whole car-making
plant comes to a halt, dabbled into PHP and setting up Postfix, Apache et al.
for a nonprofit, or sweated through Bash...

But it was all worth it, because I found my true love: PowerShell, and using it
to dig through WMI and .NET.

## What else?

When I'm not having fun working on a computer, I'm often found having fun
playing on a computer, as I'm an avid open world games player:
*Assassin's Creed* is very short of a religion for me, as another thing I
surround myself with is rows of history books, or linguistics books, or
bios... Books everywhere, really.

And books about music too, including scores, and books about musical theory,
for I am a proud bass player, and can usually get a few notes out of lots
of other instruments (which I should sto buying, BTW).

Oh, and I'm a high functioning autistic, as I was told. I wouldn't want
it any other way.

## This website

I was learning to up my Git skills, discovered the Github.io pages, and
decided to try, if only to foray into the world of static websites. It
is generated through Jekyll, served by Github.io, and uses a
barely modified version of [Taylan TatlÄ±](https://taylantatli.com/)'s
beautiful  [Moon theme](https://taylantatli.github.io/Moon/).

I took the background picture in Death Valley, CA. I called it
*And then I knew I was alive*, but that's a very long story...
